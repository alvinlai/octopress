# I enjoy making stuff people want

Over time, I've designed and built a good number of iOS, Mac applications and Ruby on Rails websites that people find useful, check out my [projects](/projects). 

When I can find time, I work on side projects that solve pain points for myself and folks I care about.

## Clojure
