<h4>Tricks</h4>

<p>Setup by smart part of ourselves to trigger the not so smart part automatically creating behaviors that result in high performance results</p>

<h4>Increasing productivity and creativity</h4>

<h4>Setting aside time</h4>

            <h4>Implementing and trying out</h4>

<p>Would take around 6 hours</p>

<h4>Processing and deciding what to stick to</h4>

<p>Would take around 8 hours</p>

<h4>One fell swoop</h4>

<p>It would be easier to tackle everything at one go</p>

<h4>Don't share!</h4>

<p>You would need your own working space</p>

<h4>Always on the go?</h4>

<p>A versatile environment would allow you to be productive even during the odd hours.</p>

<h4>Tools</h4>

<h5>Organiser</h5>

<p>It should be a tool you love, just to manage lists
You should be able to create it on the run, review it easily and regularly.
The medium doesn't matter - go for simplicity, speed and fun</p>

<h5>Filing cabinet</h5>

<p>So important to have one!
It should be so comfortable that even filing a single scribbled note would be hassle free. Instantaneous and easy.</p>

<h5>One alpha system</h5>

<p>Organise files from A-Z then separate into 4 groups, ie. A-Z, F-L, M-T, U-Z</p>

<h5>Have lots of fresh folders</h5>

<h4>Keep drawers unstuffed - archive!</h4>

<ul>
<li>Finished project notes</li>
<li>"Dead" client files</li>
</ul>

<h4>Get an auto labeller</h4>

<p>It just feels right!</p>
