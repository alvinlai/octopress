<p>I've suddenly realised that this blog has somewhat felt similar to my TJC CG25/00 website, where we had postings of interesting and useful stuff, that I had maintained a while back ago. It was graciously hosted by my army pal Pius (now defunct as he switched from Qala, which offered free webspace to Starhub).</p>

<p>And I'm glad - I've always enjoyed sharing useful and interesting bits to my readers, maybe even in my own personal <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> style.</p>

<p>I've even succumbed to buy yet another domain - <a href="http://www.moonclove.com">moonclove.com</a> and got it to point right to this blog in the meantime.</p>

<p>Moonclove sounds nice, I think it sounds cute (don't  beat me), catchy and can even represent something whacky as extraterrestial spice or even a nice name for a web application I might develop in the future.</p>

<p>My Moonclove website still ranks <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=moonclove&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">2nd and 4th</a> under google search.</p>

<p>Who knows? Someone might make me a millionaire for the domain name.</p>
