<p>Got a little confession to make, I've only been
making eggs sunny side up:</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:lJgEhAsrulexBpfnkzHa]]</p>

<p>It was a long time since I've had onion omelette, so
I pestered Mom to get those big green onions at NTUC.</p>

<p>So after the evening jog, I got down to work.</p>

<p>Didn't really think it'll turn out nice so I didn't initially
bother to take step by step pictures.</p>

<p>It was only at this stage, after heating the oil, beating the eggs
and cheerfully sizzling the onions till partially brown and
pouring in the egg.</p>

<p>Slicing it in the middle with the (what you call that cooking spade?),
I flipped it, sandwiching the still fluid raw egg mixture.</p>

<p>After flipping it around, it was finally done.</p>

<p>With slight brownish streaks coupled with juicy rings of onions
at 2cm think, it's something quite nice to munch into (I used 3 eggs at 1 go).</p>

<p>Even Mom loved the smooth in-betweens.</p>

<p>"Wa taste like cake!"</p>

<p>Haha :D</p>

<p>Oh yea the trick, if you're wondering, is to use a low flame.</p>
