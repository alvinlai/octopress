<p>I finally got my automatic labeller!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:kCjflqhnyBnoeEGJqhhA]]</p>

<p>It's a Brother P-Touch PT-1830, capable of printing labels up till 20mm thick!</p>

<p>A couple of friends have said that they could easily just write and label stuff in hand, but I digress.</p>

<p>Take a look.</p>

<p>Would you prefer this...</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:sIgoqqBgvdmsecsnFzdH]]</p>

<p>or this?</p>

<p>Which one's easier to read?</p>

<p>I'm sure you would agree with me that the latter would make filing so fun and systematic, that you might even enjoy and start labelling everything at home!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:tcksdmhIyBnfDrzunakf]]</p>

<p>Here's the full set, that I bought, the labeller package comes with a free sample label cartridge (I'm not sure how long it'll last) and beside it is a black box of another label I've purchased.</p>

<p>Typing was a breeze!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:fnGosfCftsDdyaawcHlm]]</p>

<p>Easy piecy! Printed out!</p>

<p>Brother labels are pretty nice, you can peel the labels out from the middle out, as the non sticky wax paper is split into half.</p>

<p>A closer look of the label wax paper..</p>

<p>I can't wait to get started!</p>

<p>If you're new here, you might be asking what's GTD. <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/">43Folders</a> has a good introductory article to it. When I find the time, will blog more my  GTD experience in time to come!</p>

<p>Wait for more pictures of my file folders nicely labelled in my file cabinet!</p>
