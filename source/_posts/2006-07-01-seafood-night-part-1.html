<p>With an uneventful day comprising of creating powerpoint slides for a client and a few games of <a href="http://www.dota-allstars.com">DOTA</a>, things turned out for a change when Dad suggested eating out.</p>

<p>That means...</p>

<p>Stingray!</p>

<p>This is THE bomb I tell you! Mom even had to instruct the stingray lady to go easy on the blachan :p</p>
