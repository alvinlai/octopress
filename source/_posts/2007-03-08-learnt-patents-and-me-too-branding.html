<p>My professor John Nesheim challenged us to blog what we learnt each day, so there'd be a nice log of 365 entries by the end of the year to reflect upon when I get back to Singapore, so here's the first.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can patent the non-obvious process.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not easy for big corporations who have established their brand name to emulate you and do a me-too &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; because it would only cannibalise and hurt their existing brand.</p></li>
</ol>
