title: Review your UI flow to save heartache

Puzzled that I wasn't getting any feedback for the past 2 days, I went through the new user signup flow, until I realized that the Login button for Beta users was barely noticeable:

<ol>
	<li>Previously the login link for beta users was so small it was barely noticeable.

</li>
	<li>Now it&rsquo;s bigger
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:EHlIaylwxzvxuBhmxjfB]]</p>
</li>
</ol>
Sorry for the confusion, as soon as I ran through the flow I immediately felt very very bad :(

Do yourself and your users a favor and review your flow!
