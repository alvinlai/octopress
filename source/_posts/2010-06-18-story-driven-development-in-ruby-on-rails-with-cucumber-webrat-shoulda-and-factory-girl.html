My company recently decided to give Story Driven Development in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> a go and got me to come up with an introductory tutorial.

So I came up with one that uses <a href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/" target="_blank">cucumber</a>, <a href="http://github.com/brynary/webrat" target="_blank">webrat</a>, <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda" target="_blank">shoulda</a> and <a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl" target="_blank">factory_girl</a>.

I've also documented step-by-step setup, commands and code that you can follow.

Check it out at:

and let me know what you think! =)
