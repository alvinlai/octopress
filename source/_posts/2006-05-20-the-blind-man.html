<p>My good friend Peishan from TMS recently sent me this. And its refreshing.</p>

<p>One day, there was a blind man sitting on the steps of a building with a
hat by his feet and a sign that read: "I am blind, please help."</p>

<p>A creative publicist was walking by and stopped to observe. He saw that
the blind man had only a few coins in his hat. He dropped in more coins
and, without asking for permission, took the sign and rewrote it.</p>

<p>He returned the sign to the blind man and left. That afternoon the
publicist returned to the blind man and noticed that his hat was full of
bills and coins.</p>

<p>The blind man recognized his footsteps and asked if it was he who had
rewritten his sign and wanted to know what he had written on it.</p>

<p>The publicist responded: "Nothing that was not true. I just wrote the
message a little differently." He smiled and went on his way.</p>

<p>The new sign read: "Today is Spring and I cannot see it."</p>

<p>Sometimes we need to change our strategy. If we always do what we've
always done, we'll always get what we've always gotten.</p>

<p>And remember too, sometimes it's not WHAT we say, it's HOW we say it!!</p>

<p>Chinese Proverb:
"When someone shares something of value with you and you benefit from it,
you have a moral obligation to share it with others."  </p>
