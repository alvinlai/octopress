title: Do good work while interning
published: true

<p>Why? Because you'd never know if the company you're interning at would be thinking to outsource what you've been doing for them.</p>

<p>My boss was thinking of this, but was worried about company policies regarding outsourcing work to students. Then I said no problem, my friend and I could easily set up a sole proprietorship.</p>

<p>Nothing's confirmed, but interesting developments nonetheless :)</p>

<p>Have a blessed weekend!</p>
