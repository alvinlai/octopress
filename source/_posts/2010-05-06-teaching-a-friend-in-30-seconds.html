My friend Qixiang emailed to ask how to type Chinese on a Mac, so I used Storyteller to create an online guide with annotated screenshots for every step:

<h3>
  In-built Chinese input support in Mac
</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    <p>Run System Preferences in /Applications</p> 
    
    <p class="screenshot_image">
      [[posterous-content:HHFBJFnEGbHHCtxgeJpw]]
    </p>
    
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Select language and text</p> 
    
    <p class="screenshot_image">
      [[posterous-content:AoqGtFDqEkrJefcJyutd]]
    </p>
    
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Make sure the chinese inputs u want are checked, also check the checkbox to show input menu in menu bar.</p> 
    
    <p class="screenshot_image">
      [[posterous-content:tdIwngBikzkJxnHaooJJ]]
    </p>
    
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Then you&rsquo;ll be able to type in Chinese already</p> 
    
    <p class="screenshot_image">

    </p>
    
  </li>

</ol>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

How long did I take with Storyteller? 30 seconds.
