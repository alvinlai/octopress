<p>I am so in need of manila folders! See below:</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:EwvqtbDlIqEyiEwJzBnE]]</p>

<p>Everyone just tell me to go to either 2 places:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bras Basah</li>
<li>Popular</li>
</ol>

<p>But the problem is, they just dont have these at either!</p>

<p>I need them in bulk, of a few hundred per box. They sell these in the US for US$9 for a box of 100.</p>

<p>And why do I need these, you ask.</p>

<p>For <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/">GTD</a> (Getting Things Done)!</p>

<p>And it's kinda dumb shipping paper over continents. :/</p>
