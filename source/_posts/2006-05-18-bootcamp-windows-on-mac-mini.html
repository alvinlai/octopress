<p>Got my hand to installing <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Bootcamp</a>!</p>

<p>Here's a short summary of my (excitement packed and horror filled) experience with installing Windows XP (Yes <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Windows</a>!):</p>

<p>Whilst downloading the bootcamp installer, and updating the mac mini via Software Update to the latest version, I've searched and found a <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macminiearly2006firmwareupdate101.html">firmware update</a> for the Mac Mini..</p>

            <!--more-->

            <p>Once I've done installing all 3 of the above mentioned, Bootcamp prompted me to insert my Windows XP installaton disc into the mac mini - then it restarted.</p>

<p>Viola, the familiar "Checking system system information" dos notice that appears prior to any Windows installation materialised and gave me a momentarily high - Yes! Windows!</p>

<p>All went well till I had to press Enter on my USB keyboard to resume installation. IT DIDNT WORK! My keyboard died!</p>

<p>After a couple of reboots, which ended in the same way, I realised I was not using an up to date Windows XP SP2 installation disc - oh ya!</p>

<p>Subsequent reboots didn't provide me an option to boot back to OSX even.</p>

<p>Okay. Let's just eject.</p>

<p>NO EJECT BUTTON! :O</p>

<p>Calm down. I remember the open firmware trick for the mac - just hold down alt+cmd+o+f. A prompt will appear for me to type "eject cd". Easy piecey.</p>

<p>BUT IT DIDN'T WORK!</p>

<p>After some googling, I read that Intel Macs no longer support Open Firmware and even read that some people online even had to send the whole mac back for Apple to remove the CD. There was even a brave fella that was so pissed that he had to pay a fee for it he took a knife and pried the whole mac mini apart to remove it himself.</p>

<p>I'M SO DOOMED!</p>

<p>How? The Mini came on tuesday and now it's broken with a looping Windows install. My folks are so gonna fry me :(</p>

<p>So back to more googling - I'm sure there are people who have also thread on similar ground somewhere.</p>

<p>My lucky break came when I read of a method to eject the CD. </p>

<p>Hold your breath.</p>

<p>JUST HOLD DOWN the left mouse button while the Mac Mini is starting up.</p>

<p>Once the disc popped out, you couldn't have imagined the amount of relief, praise for my Savior, and euphoria.</p>

<p>Fine. So I don't have a copy of SP2. How?</p>

<p>With some advice from a knowledgeable friend, he pointed me to an <a href="https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/~agreemt/">SoC page</a> where they gave out software for SoC students. YES! Windows XP SP2!</p>

<p>And then all went well! :D</p>

<p>Yes! Windows!</p>

<p>Whist downloading counterstrike source, I played DOTA. It's like a dream come true - ultimate smoothness!</p>

<p>Randomed Pudge, 2 teammates left, so its 3v5.
I got a triple kill at 32mins, then after hanging on with 2 barracks down, they all left. Our team then savoured the victory winning the game.</p>
