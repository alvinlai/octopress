<p>Or brainstorming.</p>


	<p>Surely you have engaged in this activity either being tasked as a school/work project or unwittingly partaking in it whilst chilling with a companion over latt&Atilde;&copy;, enjoying and building upon each other&rsquo;s random banter.</p>


	<p>At times it would be so <strong>enjoyable</strong> and you&rsquo;d just go on and on and on, seemingly churning out <strong>endless ideas</strong> that could be <strong>improved upon infinitely</strong>. On other occasions, it feels like a draining activity that sucks the life out of you, especially when its a compulsory sit-in activity that demands results.</p>


	<p>Why? Because brainstorming is a <strong>tricky business</strong> that depends on attitudes.</p>


	<p>In the class of Technology Entrepreneurship I&rsquo;m enjoying at Stanford University, I have the privilege of exploring creativity and brainstorming from Tina Seelig, the Executive Director of the <a href="http://stvp.stanford.edu/">Stanford Technology Ventures Program</a>. The next section of this blog post would be based upon what I&rsquo;ve found useful in the quest of successful brainstorming.</p>


	<h3>Rules and Tricks</h3>


	<h4>No bad ideas</h4>


	<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard this one countless times, simply put, don&rsquo;t judge ideas, whilst <strong>avoiding putting others down</strong> and psychologically stifling others, a thought might lead to an <strong>interesting related one</strong>, or potentially <strong>triggering</strong> something off the mark that could be a winning champion.</p>


	<p>An extra take-away would be to bear in mind that <strong>currently unfeasible impossible</strong> ideas can lead to potentially <strong>powerfully paradigm shifting concepts</strong>, and that&rsquo;s is what innovation is all about. This reminds me of Seth Godin suggesting marrying totally whacky concepts together.</p>


	<h4>Build on ideas</h4>


	<p>Expand on ideas, <strong>keep contributing</strong> to it, improving it without caring whether about its feasibility. It&rsquo;s <strong>not the end goal</strong> that matters, but rather the <strong>thought process</strong> and the increased possibility of <strong>branching off</strong> to cool new thoughts.</p>


	<h4>No hiearchy, but take turns</h4>


	<p>It sucks to have the thought of offending your boss or your sweetheart lingering around, so get rid of that, come to a initial common agreement that we are all but flesh and bones, and no one&rsquo;s more important than the other during that period of time. You can resume your role as the loving ever obliging boyfriend after then.</p>


	<p>Whilst its liberating to be able to contribute without any psychological niceties, brainstorming isn&rsquo;t a free for all slugfest, respect is still critical, ensuring that everyone&rsquo;s opinion get heard, easing everybody into active contribution mode.</p>


	<h4>No conformity, conventions and limits</h4>


	<p>Get rid of the norms and social expectations.</p>


	<p>Who said pigs can&rsquo;t fly? Well they might float if you pump them with enough helium.</p>


	<p>Don&rsquo;t catch me on animal rights issues now! I&rsquo;m only brainstorming!</p>


	<h4>No best idea, don&rsquo;t limit potential</h4>


	<p>The inclination to cease improvement upon reaching the ultimate end goal naturally seeps in when we feel something at its current state is perfect.</p>


	<p>How about try reframing the idea &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; like how can it be implemented in another way, medium or factor?</p>


	<h4>Wild ideas</h4>


	<p>While this wasn&rsquo;t covered in class, not stopping at taboos might yield interesting results.</p>


	<h3>The facilitator and the honored participants</h3>


	<p>In some sessions, there&rsquo;ll be someone who would be the person to invite others to come together for some good brain storming fun.</p>


	<p>Keeping in mind that participants have <strong>great honor</strong> to be part of this activity simply because your view is unique, special and valued.</p>


	<p>It&rsquo;s not easy being a facilitator, because you&rsquo;ll have to remain unbiased, steering participants without a personal agenda and reframing topics for maximum idea generation goodness. But you&rsquo;ll get better with time and practice.</p>


	<h3>Additional Tips</h3>


	<p>Fun, playful, energetic upbeat music
Unbolted furniture
Act out ideas, role play
Chocolates and caffeine are your best friend
Post its, pass it on</p>


	<h3>Ending thoughts</h3>


	<p>The type of company matters. Surround yourself with positive, constructive people who are willing to give things a second thought. Whacky ideas seldom materialize with quick presuming wet blankets :)</p>


	<p>Now. What do you think?</p>
