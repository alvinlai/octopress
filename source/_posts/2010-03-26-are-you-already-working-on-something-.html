In an <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2219-jason-calacanis-vs-david-heinemeier-hansson-on-this-week-in-startups">interview with Jason Calacanis</a>, DHH mentioned how he got acquainted with his now co-founder, Jason Fried.

Fried posted a PHP question on his company's blog, which DHH answered in detail. Fried decided that it was much better to hire DHH than to do it himself so he got him on board. There, DHH did the programming stuff, while Fried and his company focused on design.

They were a web design and development shop, consulting.

Then they encountered their pain point of communicating with customers and staying organized. After looking in vain for a solution, they decided to build Basecamp, which focused on communication rather than traditional project management.

And all this time, they were blogging about what they love, design and usability so they had an active and targeted audience.

Notice that they were already creating value and wealth before they started Basecamp and abstracted Ruby on Rails from it.

Rather than focusing on coming up with your big idea, are you already working on something that you're excited about and figuring out what pain points you already have?
