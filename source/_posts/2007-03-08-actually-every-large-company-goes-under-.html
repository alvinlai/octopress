title: Actually, every large company goes under..

<p>I really like [[posterous-content:ErpjuxcaBilxGwuaBaet]] Seth Godin phrase:</p>

<p>"Actually, every large company goes under... except for the large companies that take risks and reinvent themselves. The rest of us just fade away, sooner rather than later."</p>

<p>Then he goes on to prod us, even more so we should start doing our own thing if we were to succeed.</p>

<p>"Actually, the top spots and large investment stakes in big companies are pretty much all taken, so if you weren't lucky enough to end up on top, (or if you don't want to spend your career waiting for your boss to die) the only way in the world you're going to succeed is by doing your own thing, building your own division or starting your own gig... and by teaching the big guys a thing or two."</p>

<p>Aren't you convinced yet?</p>
