title: Great Customer Service & Frankness as an Angry Excuse
published: true
---
<p>It can be frustrating when things do not go as planned &acirc;&euro;&rdquo;
miscommunication, technical difficulties, unexpected long
waiting times you name it.</p>

<p>It is right for the service provider to test his system,
but not at the expense of the waiting customer, who is already
miffed at the problem.</p>

<p>The tipping point comes when the customer receives an
insult in exchange for an attempt to seek redress for
the inconvenience.</p>

<p>The business would not only lose that customer, but potentially
hundreds that customer would recommend against the service.</p>

<p>A mistake a startup cannot afford to make.</p>

<p>Frankness is good in many aspects like maintaining healthy
relationships to attaining better understanding. </p>

<p>But when it is used as an excuse for reckless venting,
it might be better to remain silent about it in the first place.</p>

<p>One good rule of thumb when addressing an issue frankly is
to ask yourself, am I using this privilege of being frank
as an excuse for anger? </p>

<p>Some good silent thought process before a frank encounter
goes a long way.</p>
