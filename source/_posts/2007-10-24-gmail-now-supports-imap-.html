<p>What does this mean for you?</p>


	<p>Previously, Gmail only supports the <span class="caps">POP3</span> protocol, and now we have <span class="caps">IMAP</span>. So what?</p>


	<p>Now, gmail conversations you read in Exchange or Apple Mail.app are also reflected as marked in gmail.</p>


	<p>Woo!</p>
