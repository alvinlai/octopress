<p>I'm not sure if it's the case for most of you, but I've found it increasingly difficult to get to know new music.</p>

<p>Maybe I've grown out of techno. I need a breather from classical.</p>

<p>Maybe a friend has sent you a single song that you really like but don't know where of that came from.</p>

<p>Sure you could check out the other songs from the same artist. But what if you could get to know new songs that feel similiar?</p>

<h4>In comes Last.FM</h4>

<p>The sky got a little clearer when I finally stumbled back on <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a>. A webservice that introduces music based on similar artists you specifiy.</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but you could only listen to a limited number of 30 second samples from the website when you search for an artist.</p>

<p>And you even have to sign up to preview the 30second tracks. Oh well, I signed up grudgingly and guess what I stumbled on? </p>

<h4>A Last.FM Player application download!</h4>

<p>It recommended me the Mac OSX version, but there are also Windows (maybe Linux) versions for download too.</p>

<h4>And what does it do?</h4>

<p>Search for an artist and it plays <strong>FULL</strong> length tracks of similiar music!</p>

<p>Such a godsend. :D</p>

<p>Searched for Stevie Ray Vaughan and what did it get me? Led Zepplin Stairway to heaven, another of my favourites.</p>

<p>Found another nice band! </p>

<p>The Allman Brothers Band - In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.</p>

<p>Anyone has the CD? :D</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
