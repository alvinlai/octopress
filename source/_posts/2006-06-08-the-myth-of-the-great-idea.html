<ul>
<li>Waiting for Great Idea
<ul>
<li>Excuse for not doing anything - dangerous!</li>
<li>Waste time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Success
<ul>
<li>Never comes from mind-blowing idea</li>
<li>Comes from a basic idea executed amazingly well</li>
<li>Rarely found by thinking</li>
<li>Are found by doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A great idea is a myth</li>
<li>Now what?
<ul>
<li>Do better than most people</li>
<li>Stop searching and start doing</li>
<li>Identify a broad, high-level goal - an industry, lifestyle or financial outcome</li>
<li>Identify things you like and dislike - be brutally honest</li>
<li>Identify opportunities that open up more doors in the right area</li>
<li>Avoid jobs/projects/opportunities that lead to dead ends</li>
<li>Take multiple steps to reach a goal</li>
<li>Eliminating choices
<ul>
<li>Internships are like free trials at a company</li>
<li>Chalk up now-I-know-I-don't-like-that category</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start doing
<ul>
<li>Finding the right people to talk to</li>
<li>Finding out what people actually need</li>
<li>May be lacking in style, but doesn't matter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember
<ul>
<li>The Myth of a great idea is a great way to think yourself into oblivion and failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At our age
<ul>
<li>Nothing wrong with not knowing what we want to ultimately end up doing</li>
<li>Stop feeling guilty</li>
<li>But there's something ENTIRELY wrong with not actively trying to find out exactly what we want.</li>
<li>Trying, not waiting.</li>
<li>Experimenting, not "thinking about it"</li>
<li>Give it a shot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
