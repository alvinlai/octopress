<p>How to do what you love</p>

<ol>
<li>Realize that you can love work</li>
<li>Most of the time, a college student would be wrong about knowing what he loves - working on severely limited information</li>
<li>Seek jobs that let you do many different things, so you can learn faster what various kinds of work are like</li>
<li>Constraints give your life shape, remove them and most people don't know what to do - lottery winners</li>
<li>Always produce</li>
<li>Do a good job to make sure you're not using dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy - gets into the habit of doing things well.</li>
<li>Finding work you love requires discipline.</li>
<li>Don't be distracted by prestige and money.</li>
</ol>
