<p />
<div>I'm really excited to write this post! Finally, my app is available on the iPhone app store!</div>
<p />
<div>
<div>If you're keen on the technical implementation, the live stock prices are updated via Comet Push Programming, while the other apps available on the app store now seem to be periodically updated (every 1 or 2 seconds) via polling.</div>
<p />
<div>This approach helps to save battery life and data usage since no data would be transferred when there's no price change.</div>
<p />
<div>Additionally, I think the interface is a tad more intuitive and better suited for traders &ndash; being able to have all:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Buy price</li>
<li>Sell price</li>
<li>Buy volume</li>
<li>Sell volume</li>
<li>High</li>
<li>Low</li>
<li>Last Done</li>
<li>Volume</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>to elegantly toggle on or off at your fingertips is something that no other apps available are offering.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Most of them usually have maximum 3 fields you can select to show at once and the multiple taps needed to customize is unacceptable for traders.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Technically, updating so many fields that are updated live while maintaing scrolling performance in the iPhone's table view is a challenge, which probably explains why the other apps just give you 3 fields at most.</div>
<p />
<div>These are the 2 key differentiators, let me know if you like to know more! =)</div>
