<p>After staying in California for slightly more than a month, this is my first blog post in Silicon Valley!</p>

<p>Apologies to all you friends out there who keep asking me to update my blog and post pictures!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:snmFpibJJegeGGbGDtfv]]</p>

<p>Here's one for starters &acirc;&euro;&rdquo; my first meal in california: an In-and-Out Burger!</p>

<p>I have been contemplating real hard whether to migrate my blog to a new platform (Mephisto or SimpleLog) and to remove like 8000+ Trackback spam and 14000+ Comment spam. (Which I have just removed)</p>

<p>I've finally decided to stick with Typo as I kinda like it's interface, not to mention the uber-cool integration with Textmate.</p>

<p>2am and I gotta work tomorrow.. stay tuned for updates! =)</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Happy Chinese New Year! Finally migrated to the Mephisto blog engine woo! Pictures coming up soon!</p>
