<p>What a night!</p>

<p>Got an sms from a friend who has a friend looking for someone to go on TV to talk about expectations of job seekers from the perspectives of young adults.</p>

<p>Just the topic that I'm passionate about!</p>

<p>Well the only catch is.. its on <a href="http://u.mediacorptv.com">Channel U</a>! A mandarin channel!</p>

<p>Oh man! Friends who know me all say I can't speak Mandarin for nuts and have all given up.</p>

<p>I prayed about it.</p>

<p>My friend arranged for her friend to give me a call to check me out.</p>

<p>Received a phone call from her and after chatting for about what seemed like 45 minutes (I was amazed at how God enables) in mandarin (unbelievable!), she told me I'm in!</p>

<p>Far East Plaza, this saturday, 12 August at 12pm.</p>

<p>Miraculous!</p>
