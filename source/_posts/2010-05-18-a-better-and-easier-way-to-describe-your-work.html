After I finished developing an AJAX feedback form that would send the company an email when our users used it, I wanted to show my team what to expect from this new feature.

Rather than typing tiresome bullet points of text and expecting my team to predict and imagine what it would look like, I just told my story with step-by-step screenshots.
<ol>
	<li>Click to send feedback
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:sibjxlpzlhnGcxshBGGh]]</p>
</li>
	<li>But user&rsquo;s not logged in
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:veEyAlEfHeDuFAHhpEol]]</p>
</li>
	<li>So login..
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:DnzgkFuhIdBeeopkGqqA]]</p>
</li>
	<li>User tries clicking again
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:JnAmCdDGauEerkIpBBlx]]</p>
</li>
	<li>Facebox appears with feedback form.User fills up, clicks &ldquo;Send feedback&rdquo; without entering any feedback
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:dcvFabJoBJtDcxAcvpEe]]</p>
</li>
	<li>Alert, telling him that he needs to enter feedback
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:jxJasxjEtylBhDuIFwbv]]</p>
</li>
	<li>User fills out feedback description and hits send feedback
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:jBwxoreevEDkfuxtcxkB]]</p>
</li>
	<li>Feedback successful.User can close the facebox
<p class="screenshot_image">[[posterous-content:unfipmiiyHJrbGJCAqCe]]</p>
</li>
</ol>
Isn't this descriptive and fun to look at?
