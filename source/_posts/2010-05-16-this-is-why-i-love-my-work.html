<a href="http://freshlog.com" title="Freshlog" target="_blank">Freshlog</a> is a product I made to scratch my own itch &ndash; creating screenshot-attached messages (in project management services like <a href="http://basecamphq.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> and bug trackers like <a href="http://unfuddle.com" target="_blank">Unfuddle</a>) in one step.

	<li>A few days back, I did some upgrading and broke a feature, which prompted one of my customers, Casey from Techskull to send a support request.

	<li>As soon as I got wind of it, I fixed the bug.

</li>
	<li>Casey replied to ask me to look at a screenshot she took.

I didn&rsquo;t even notice the title of the friendly <span class="caps">URL</span> as the first thought I had was: did I miss something out?

	<li>Only to be super, super pleasantly surprised! =)

Thank you so much Casey!

I can&rsquo;t adequately describe how much this means to me and my work on Freshlog.

I actually teared a little.

A chapter titled &ldquo;Make a dent in the universe&rdquo; in the book <a href="http://37signals.com/rework" target="_blank">Rework</a> by <a href="http://37signals.com" target="_blank">37signals</a> reads:

&ldquo;To do great work, you need to feel that you&rsquo;re making a difference. That you&rsquo;re putting a meaningful dent in the universe. That you&rsquo;re part of something important &hellip;&rdquo;

&ldquo;&hellip; You want your customers to say, &lsquo;This makes my life better.&rsquo; You want to feel that if you stopped doing what you do, people would notice.&rdquo;

So true. This is why I love what I do.
