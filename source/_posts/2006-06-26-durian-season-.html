<p>Bought Mom's favourite chinese pastries from the famous Thye Lee</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:dbAoCnshbyaFdEsDcbyk]]</p>

<p>They've been consistently yummylicious, with the thin crisp outer skin
and rich sweet inner lotus paste. Absolutely fabulous.</p>

<p>Then Mom returned with a red bundle of suprise.</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:sdoxriJsHDnCsorgccGE]]</p>

<p>I took one up, examined its texture.</p>

<p>The slightly moist reflective skin indicated ripeness.
It felt a little squishy too!</p>

<p>I couldn't resist squeezing.. </p>

<p>[[posterous-content:CenAuEtqAaqkzkHhBCEp]]</p>

<p>Splat! Squeezed a little too hard, sending bits of durian cream
on my face and all over in the vicinity of 1 meter.</p>

<p>Joking.. :D I simply took a bite.</p>

<p>It really felt like custard pie, only creamier and sweeter!</p>

<p>The durian season is here!</p>
