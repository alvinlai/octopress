A few days ago, as I was using Freshlog for replying customer queries, I felt some tedious bits in the process I could do without. In just a few hours, I developed a working prototype to solve that pain point.

A while ago when <a href="http://productblog.37signals.com/products/2010/03/freshlog.html" target="_blank">37signals covered Freshlog on their product blog</a>, I took the opportunity to <a href="http://alvinlai.com/2010/03/31/make-money-online-teaching-your-passion-and-solving-your-pain-point/">share how I came up with the idea for Freshlog</a>. Not surprising that this new project came about from a personal pain point too.

I'm pleased to present you <a href="http://storyteller.freshlog.com" target="_blank">Storyteller</a>, my latest project that solves my own pain point, hopefully it'll solve yours too. :)
