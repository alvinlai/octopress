<p>Excited about this phenomenal language that's so easy to use, flexibly powerful for most tasks, yet is actually fun to work with?</p>

<p>Then you might be interested to join <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/singapore-rb">singapore.rb</a>!</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com">rssfwd</a>'s author <a href="http://www.yanime.org">Choon Keat</a> (also a member of singapore.rb) says, "It's a young group, so be gentle :-D"!</p>

<p>8 of us from Singapore.rb managed to meet up at City Hall's Starbucks, with a couple of us displaying makeshift handwritten notepad signs of "RUBY SG" and "Ruby on Rails" on the coffee tables just to draw attention, a first for myself! :D</p>

<p>Among the ruby fans, there were an interesting bunch dealing with embedded systems, electronic payment (like point of sales), a technopreneur looking at improving workflows and customer relations of SMEs, web designers and developers.</p>

<p>We had a good exchange of how Ruby/Rails had helped them in their work and their hobbyist pursuits, interesting in every way.</p>

<p>There was also an energetic discussion RESTful paradigms for rails :)</p>

<p>Check us out!</p>
