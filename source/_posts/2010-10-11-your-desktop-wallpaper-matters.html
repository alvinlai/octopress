title: Your desktop wallpaper matters
published: true

<p>A decade ago, I was a small boy fussing about choosing nice, artistic, cool looking wallpapers for my Windows desktop.&nbsp;After a while, I told myself that wallpapers aren't worth fussing over. The default Windows cloud-field wallpaper would do.</p>
<p>Then I started using the Mac. Tiger's blue twisty wallpaper's nice, Leopard's space pic looks cool, Snow Leopard's really quite sweet.  Until I felt a little uninspired lately, and I looked at my desktop &ndash; it looks too familiar now.</p>
<p>No longer emitting any coolness and not mysterious enough for me to lose myself.  Then I went back to the wallpaper site I fussed about when I was a little boy:  <a href="http://digitalblasphemy.com">http://digitalblasphemy.com</a></p>
<p>Sadly, a good chunk of the good stuff's made into paid products, but I still managed to get some freebies to make myself feel like a small boy who fussed about his wallpaper again.</p>
