<p>Whenever I recommend the Mac or OSX as a replacement for Windows for their workstations, friends would undoubtedly agree that it is way better in many aspects, right up till they come to the point of gaming.</p>

<p>While I agree that it doesn't support the full plethora of game titles Windows does, it certainly sports the more popular titles like Warcraft <em>fav</em></p>

<p>With the introduction of the Apple Macbook, the replacement for the iBook (don't confuse this with the Macbook Pro, the Powerbook replacement), you would probably have heard that it is one of the fastest laptops you can get right now for $1.7k (education price). </p>

<p>Very much like its elder brother the Macbook Pro, it just falls short of graphics with an Intel integrated graphics chip which borrows heavily from the main system RAM, inevitably hindering gaming performance in graphic intensive games.</p>

<p>But there seems to be a glimmer of hope for you folks out here content with playing slightly older games like Warcraft and Quake 3 - just by increasing RAM.</p>
