<p>My room upstairs. When we got the place, the room was EMPTY, my room mate
and I had to sleep in sleeping bags! We gradually got 2nd hand furniture from garage
sales posted via <a href="http://www.craigslist.com">craigslist</a> and made it nice and cosy.</p>

<p>Queen sized spring mattress, with Ralph Lauren comforter, and the reading lamp+chair combination that I've always wanted! :)</p>
