<p>With just <strong>3 months</strong> left in the Valley, it&rsquo;s a good time to look back.</p>


	<p>Very different from a regular student exchange program, groups of <a href="http://www.overseas.nus.edu.sg/noc/"><span class="caps">NUS</span> Overseas Colleges</a> participants in Silicon Valley actually get a job <strong>working full time</strong> for a salary, get together to form households, rent full sized houses, buy their own cars, pay their own bills, you get the idea, it&rsquo;s very much like <strong>settling down</strong> in America, for real.</p>


	<p>The <a href="http://www.overseas.nus.edu.sg/noc/"><span class="caps">NUS</span> Overseas Colleges</a> program is quoted from its website to &ldquo;infuse a spirit of enterprise into <span class="caps">NUS</span> education, providing <span class="caps">NUS</span> students with a globally-oriented educational experience.&rdquo;</p>


	<p>Indeed, that is true, with so many valuable components painstakingly pieced together over the years and only made possible with the work done by the people before us, with <strong>staff like Jupe</strong> forming strategic alliances with high technology startup companies for internships and <strong>previous batches of <span class="caps">NOC</span> students</strong> handing down contacts and relationships of worthy organizations and individuals.</p>


	<p>Because of this we are very privileged to be able to have very awe-inspiring <strong>mentors</strong> like CEOs from <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.meebo.com">Meebo</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and so on.</p>


	<p>The <strong>buddy system</strong> where the incumbent batch would be assigned to help the incoming junior batch to ease in and settle down is especially <strong>heartwarming</strong>, as it encourages the <strong>spirit of paying it forward</strong>, forming <strong>close friendships</strong> the process.</p>


	<p>All these would <strong>never be easy for a single person starting up here alone</strong> (actually I know of just one, the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Red Pod). We are so lucky to be able to benefit from the <strong>time accumulated fruits of labour</strong>!</p>


	<p>But of course that&rsquo;s pretty much what everybody enjoys in the process, are there other <strong>intangible and subtle</strong> stuff that is not immediately obvious to the onlookers?</p>


	<p>Plenty!</p>


	<p>Just being here with a couple of friends in this big wonderland called America with plenty things to do, I&rsquo;ve become a more <strong>independent and resourceful</strong> person, constantly finding out the hows and the wheres to do new crazy exciting stuff.</p>


	<p>I&rsquo;ve done crazy <strong>hikes</strong> and scaled half dome in Yosemite National Park, planned and executed a successful and <strong>enjoyable outdoor camp trip</strong> where we slept under the stars, met up with a stranger who works in Intel to go <strong>para-gliding</strong> and many more!</p>


	<p><strong>Moving out of my comfort zone</strong>, charting out and venturing into previously unexplored places. Getting lost and finding your way around, being ever ready to take on challenges and conquer the unexpected.</p>


	<p>I will return to Singapore <strong>stronger, better and ever ready</strong> to take on new challenges that come by my way.</p>


	<p>Just a mere 3 months, and I&rsquo;ll be back. Life will never be the same again :)</p>
