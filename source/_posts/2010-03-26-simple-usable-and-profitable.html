You've read 37signals' book <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/" target="_blank">Getting Real</a> about building simple but wonderfully executed web applications and appreciate Apple's approach to usable and elegant design.

You encountered a frustrating task and came up with a neat solution to your pain point. You got great feedback, tweaked your product and people love your software.

You were excited, almost in a hurry to launch and missed out applying key advice on building buzz that you've read.

You launch and now you enjoy
<ul>
	<li>Waking up excited to read emails about your product containing
<ul>
	<li>Questions, praise and testimonials</li>
	<li>Product reviews and integration requests</li>
	<li>Successful purchase payments</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Satisfaction knowing your product has helped yourself and others like you</li>
	<li>Profiting from your product</li>
</ul>
While your product has become profitable, it did not grow as huge as you've wanted it to. You had to change your business model from an initial monthly subscription service to a one-off paid purchase.

Now you want to go a step further to build a monthly subscription based business that solves your own pain point also shared by others.

And you want to do it better learning from your past experiences.

How would you go about discovering a new personal pain point you'd be excited to solve again in a simple, usable and profitable manner?
