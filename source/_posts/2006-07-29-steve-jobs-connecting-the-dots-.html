title: Steve Jobs. Connecting the dots.
published: true
---
<p>On my way back home, I've stumbled on the podcast of Steve Job's commencement address at Stanford university while scanning through for a song.</p>

<p>For the 15 minutes waiting for the bus, I went through his speech again and I thought it would be useful for me to jot down the salient points of his inspiring speech.</p>

<p>Here's it. I hope to make a difference like what Steve has done with his life and I believe you can if you'd like to, too.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Connecting the dots</p>

<ul>
<li>Follow curiosity and intuition</li>
<li>Find out what's facinating, beautiful and subtle
<ul>
<li>Might not have any direct practical application </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impossible to connect the dots forward
<ul>
<li>Believe that God has a way for you</li>
<li>Trust in something, believing that the dots will connect down
<ul>
<li>the road, will give you the confidence to follow your heart
<ul>
<li>even if it leads you off the well worn path
<ul>
<li>that will make all the difference</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love and Loss</p>

<ul>
<li>Still love what I do. Rejected but still in love. Start over.</li>
<li>Getting fired - heaviness of being successful replaced by
<ul>
<li>lightness of being a beginner again
<ul>
<li>Less sure about everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Freed and enabled one of the creative periods of his life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Awful tasting medicine but the patient needed it</li>
<li>Sometimes life hits you in the face with a brick, don't lose faith</li>
<li>Only thing that kept him going was that he loved what he did</li>
<li>You got to find what you love</li>
<li>True for work and lovers
<ul>
<li>Work gonna fill up large part of life
<ul>
<li>Only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe what is great work</li>
<li>Only way to do great work is to love what you do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep looking and don't settle</li>
<li>As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it</li>
<li>As with any great relationship, it gets better and better as the years go on</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Death</p>

<ul>
<li>"If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you'll most certainly be right"</li>
<li>If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?</li>
<li>And if it's no for too many days in a row, I need to change something</li>
<li>Remember that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool that I've encountered to
<ul>
<li>help me make the big choices in life</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Almost everything - all external expectations. pride, fear of embarrassment or failure
<ul>
<li>All fall away in the face of death</li>
<li>Leaving what's truly important</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking
<ul>
<li>you have something to lose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are already naked, there is no reason not to follow your heart</li>
<li>No one want to die</li>
<li>Death is the destination we all share</li>
<li>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life</li>
<li>Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking
<ul>
<li>Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition
<ul>
<li>They somehow already know what you truly want to become
<ul>
<li>Every thing else is secondary</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
