<p>Finally its here!</p>

<p>Remember playing quake or counterstrike and having to pull out the cool console/terminal ingame to type in some commands to change a game level or something?</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:wCkCFnmcydEnIBIyAmph]]</p>

<p>Something like this.</p>

<p>Now there's Visor that brings that to the Mac desktop! Check out my screenshot!</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>

<p>You can bind a shortcut key to call it up with a nice transition effect with customizable delay.</p>

<p>The nice thing is Visor automatically hides when u click on another application, so it doesn't get in your way. </p>

<p>And of course it retains the session/remembers what you typed even after it hides so you can resume work after recalling it.</p>

<p>Get rocking with Visor <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/visor/visor">here</a>!</p>
