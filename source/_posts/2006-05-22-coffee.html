<p>Got this interesting bit from Peishan too, enjoy!</p>

<p>A group of alumni, highly established in their careers, got together to
visit their old university Professor. <em>* *</em>Conversation soon turned into
complaints about stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the
Prof went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and an
assortment of cups: porcelain, plastic, glass, some plain-looking and some
expensive and exquisite, telling them to help themselves to hot coffee. *</p>

<p>*When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the lecturer said "If
you noticed, all the nice-looking, expensive cups were taken up, leaving
behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is but normal for you to want only
the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress. *</p>

<p>*What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you consciously
went for the better cups and are eyeing each other's cups."  "Now, if Life
is coffee, then the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They
are just tools to hold and contain life, but the quality of Life doesn't
change. "Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the
coffee in it." *</p>

<p>So friend, don't let the cups drive you...   enjoy the coffee instead.</p>
