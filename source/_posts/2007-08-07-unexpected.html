	<p>The gorgeous beach!</p>


	<p>First off, it&rsquo;s really been a while since I&rsquo;ve updated the blog, apologies friends, mom and pop who have been constantly checking back to see if there&rsquo;s anything new :)</p>


	<p>There&rsquo;s just so much to do here besides working at a startup company and taking Stanford courses, meeting entrepreneurs, helping out with events &amp; projects and having fun with travelling! Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Los Angeles to name a famous few :)</p>


	<p>I&rsquo;ve also found time to contribute a theme to an open source project <a href="http://www.amahi.org">Amahi</a> :</p>

	<p>Silicon Valley&rsquo;s amazing. Lots of unexpected stuff, just a few days ago, a stealth startup entrepreneur I totally do not know sent me a private message on Facebook asking me to meet up at Starbucks for a cup of coffee. We met and had a good discussion on topics relevant to his stealth startup, potentially able to get him on as a mentor for my other friends at <span class="caps">NUSEA</span>.</p>


	<p>Potentially many things to do here! Must prioritize! :)</p>
