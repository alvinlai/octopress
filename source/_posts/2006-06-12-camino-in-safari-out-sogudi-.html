title: Camino in, Safari out. Sogudi?

<p>What's with Safari these days? It's been pissing me off with the ever frequent beachball (Mac OSX's equivalent of the busy hour glass).</p>

<p>The last straw came when I had to forcefully terminate whilst working on some AJAX scripts.</p>

<p>I turned to Camino, a mac specific browser based on the same Gecko rendering engine that made Firefox famous for its accuracy in rendering webpages.</p>

<p>Specially created for the Mac, Camino is tightly integrated using native Cocoa.</p>

<p>The only thing that you might miss from  Safari is probably Sogudi, a plugin that allows you to do instant wikipedia searches like "wikip manhattan project" or google searches with "g steve yang".</p>

<p>A quick google search provided the <a href="http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2006/02/16/el_camino_re/#c025210">answer</a>.</p>

<p>Here's it:</p>

<p>Just open Show All Bookmarks, add a new Bookmark, for instance:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s&amp;go=Go">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%s&amp;go=Go</a></p>

<p>and assign a keyword. Like "wp". Then, type
wp Camino
in the location bar, et voila!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
