<p>I think many would be pretty suprised when I mention of meeting my primary school classmates for BBQ. It's like who keeps in touch with theirs?</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:mezaahCzyrGsnFxwtolg]]</p>

<p>I'm thankful to meet them after parting ways for more than a decade since the Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE). There's also this warm fuzzy feeling when you try to piece names to faces and recall class seating positions.</p>

<p>We also had lots of fun trying to compile the full name list of our P6 class, updating each other about whereabouts and sharing nostalgic experiences.</p>

<p>The BBQ at Pasir Ris Park pit 36 was nice. After CiBao and I set us up the fire (I couldn't resist the set us up the bomb pun haha), the ladies wanted to grill the crab sticks.</p>

<p>The only problem was, the crab sticks would fray above the open fire and we didn't buy aluminum foil. We came up with the idea of finishing the Otaks (yummy spicy flavored fish slabs pre grilled in banana leaves) and using the banana leaves as placeholders:</p>

<p>It was an interesting sight.</p>

<p>The fire was glowing a nice amber and the food done in an utmost surprisingly delectable manner, with unbelievable great tasting chicken wings seasoned with honey garlic BBQ sauce at the last minute.</p>

<p>The fish balls were heartwarmingly tangy too.</p>

<p>XiaoJing couldn't really bear to eat some of the food after a discussion of cruel slaughter methods, and I was chided for saying "hey more body parts, oops wings!" haha..</p>

<p>YanShan was really capable in keeping the place spick and span and was unbeatable with the finances.</p>

<p>ChuanYun.. A new face and a new name for me today! "Pass Transport", a nice mnemonic!</p>

<p>Jihua came shortly after and man has he changed. Looking damn fit sia!</p>

<p>After the BBQ, Jihua drove us (Yes all 6 of us, including himself) to White Sands for a drink at Macdonalds.</p>

<p>Just as we were leaving, a Macdonald's auntie came to help clear our drinks.</p>

<p>The next moment she came up to ask us: "Did you know that Pasir Ris starts the day half an hour later than the rest of Singapore?" all that in perfect mandarin.</p>

<p>She said that during her time, the government wanted Pasir Ris to have the same time as the rest of Singapore, for purposes of time synchronized stock exchange with the Malaysian stock market, understandably for economic reasons.</p>

<p>"But is this good for the people?", she questions, throwing us aback.</p>

<p>Ah, the opposition, I thought to myself.</p>

<p>She goes on to explain that its not healthy to wake up prematurely, then going on to the situation of school children (in Pasir Ris) waking up extra early, due to the time discrepancy.</p>

<p>In a nice transition, she mentions herself as a teacher back then fearfully teaching the son of a rich indian man, whose name wasn't officially enrolled, under instruction of the principal.</p>

<p>She relates how she gave extra lessons to her EM3 students back then, helping them, only to be faced with disagreement from her superiors.</p>

<p>Rather than increasing the salary of teaching staff for some reason I forgot, she felt that the education system should focus on solving problems associated with the EM3 system.</p>

<p>Battling with her conscience, she quit the teaching profession that pays a monthly $3000 for a research assistant job at NUS that pays $700, a noble sacrifice for aspirations, I think, and finally ending up at Macdonalds for $400 a month.</p>

<p>Was she ranting? Maybe. But it was a refreshing take on things, interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>Kena chided for being too patient with her by the rest later.</p>

<p>A splendid evening it is :)</p>
