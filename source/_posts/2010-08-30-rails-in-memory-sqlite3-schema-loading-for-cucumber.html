This is a quick note to myself, ask me if you'd like to find out more.

You'd like to load your db schema everytime you run cucumber, here's how.

Add this in env.rb:


  <pre>Before do
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(ActiveRecord::Base.configurations['test'])
  ActiveRecord::Schema.verbose = false
  load &quot;#{RAILS_ROOT}/db/schema.rb&quot;
end</pre>
