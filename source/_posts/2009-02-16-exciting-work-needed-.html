Hi there!

I'm Alvin and my friends know me as an unrepentant geek whom they can turn to for solutions.

I love <strong>hacking</strong> (don't mix that up with the illegal stuff), putting things together that aren't meant to be used by default in a certain way to solve problems.

Some of my previous endeavors include setting up a Linksys SPA-3102 VOIP gateway at home to make cheap outgoing mobile calls via 3G on the go at landline rates, turning an old Sony Ericsson k750i cellphone into an SMS-sending GSM modem (via AT commands), web scraping of wunderground.com using rubyful soup (Hpricot does this easily now), installing GentooX (a linux distribution) on the XBox to run as a bit torrent server.

Lately, I've been messing about with objective-C iPhone development and I've just finished working on an app of mine (hopefully Apple approves it for the appstore!).

I'm also competent with Ruby on Rails, PHP, Linux, SQL and I have an eye for design, designing vector art with Adobe Illustrator &ndash; Probably just enough to launch a startup! :D

So drop me an email!
