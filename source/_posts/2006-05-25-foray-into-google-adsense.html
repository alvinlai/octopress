<p>Why did I start adding advertisements to this fresh new blog? You might ask, have I gotten greedy?</p>

<p>Oh no, that's the beginning of distracting, non-relevant advertisements, you might think.</p>

<p>While it's true that I get to collect a little passive income from the advertisements, there's also another compelling reason to do so, one that would benefit <strong>you</strong>, my precious blog reader, to a great extent.</p>

<h3>So.. What's in it for you?</h3>

<p>But before going into how you can benefit from the addition of Google Adsense to this blog, it only makes sense (I couldn't resist the pun) to give a quick overview of how Google Adsense works.</p>

<h4>Google Adsense is Special</h4>

<p>Unlike any other ordinary static or rotating advertisement banner systems, this advertising system from the <a href="http://www.google.com">world's best online search company</a> has an interesting twist in connecting the advertising industry with its forte in relevant search. </p>

<p>The difference arises with Google Adsense <em>scanning the content of the blog, looking out for relevant keywords</em> to try to match its database of advertisements which equates to..</p>

<h4>Article Relevant Ads!</h4>

<p>Which can act as a quick reference to see additional information related to the blog's content. </p>

<p>So next time, after reading an article, it might be interesting to check out what Google Adsense has found relevant.</p>

<p>Got questions on Google Adsense, ask me! I'm also learning about Adsense in the meanwhile and it would be interesting to find out what others think of it.</p>
