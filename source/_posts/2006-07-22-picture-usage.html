<p>It's interesting and even feels flattering when people from all over the world use your pictures for their stuff, as evidenced from <a href="http://ko-jay.blogspot.com/2006/07/durian-season.html">Kojay's Blog</a>.</p>

<p>I just thought that it would be nice if he could acknowledge me a little, like say "Even our singaporean counterparts love them, like Alvin Lai from Singapore!"</p>

<p>Then after notifying me that he has graciously linked to me, I would naturally link him back, resulting in increased traffic for both parties, a win-win situation!</p>

<p>I'm not complaining, just thinking of some unexplored territory here :)</p>

<p>Take my pictures if you like, I don't watermark them but please drop me a note! I'll be more than glad to get to know you better :)</p>
