<p>Happy birthday Yingli and Xinyi! My JC classmates of CG25 decided to celebrate with crab this fine Saturday evening.</p>

<p>I was initially puzzled having to meet at 1730 for dinner. Upon reaching I understood why.</p>

<p>And mind you, it's not a restaurant or anything. It's a KOPI TIAM (COFFEE SHOP)! We started queueing at 1800 and the kopitiam auntie was like broadcasting a 60 to 90 minute wait for a table, even suggesting to try out a rival kopitiam just across the carpark!</p>

<p>Eventually the queue spilled onto the carpark and they had to redirect it.</p>

<p>I can't resist Xinyi's expression here :)</p>

<p>They even take orders while we queue to ensure that our crabbies arrive promptly when we get a table!</p>

<p>The birthday girls beaming when we're finally next in line for a table. Notice the sign at the background, it reads: Please Q For Table N Order, Thank You.</p>

<p>Interesting!</p>

<p>Just look at the queue that formed behind us! Singaporeans will die for food.</p>

<p>A group of a while later, we learnt that a group of expatriates came by and unknowingly occupied a table was meant for us, without realizing that you actually had to queue to eat at this kopitiam.</p>

<p>Additional waiting time..</p>

<p>We got a table! Look at the happy girls.</p>

<p>And a hungry Bingxiong :) Joel looks like he's wielding a light saber on his head :/ We finally got the table at 1910 - a 70minute wait!</p>

<p>Here comes the food!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:ivnawubmxIulqqunyogl]]</p>

<p>Fried bread to go with the crab sauces..</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:zfJfpossnxhzkBxpaxIx]]</p>

<p>Playboy Chicken. Serious! That's what it's called! It tastes damn good too!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:JEznhtvsiitkbgdlofwE]]</p>

<p>Paper wrapped ribs.</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:owAbrwzqGobkqtruEAlg]]</p>

<p>Wok egg toufu. This is the bomb I tell you.</p>

<p>Front shot of the first crab. Butter crab! This is just sinfully delectable man.</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:owICgyxojktEdCkGGycw]]</p>

<p>Rear shot! They use fresh lettuce which goes so well with the sauce! Ohhh!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:qhyBvGurAFlIfqusGcgx]]</p>

<p>Frontal shot of the black pepper crab. Apologies for the unfocused picture.. Didn't have many clean fingers left after the butter crab :p</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:ItbftiEGJtwyEaIbuAcg]]</p>

<p>Rear shot.. Thank you everyone for patiently waiting for me to take a shot before attacking the crab haha..</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:lmxzAgxEDIIJAwDxprDJ]]</p>

<p>Damn solid the meat I tell you!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:unBzEyjqayIgGlaigEEa]]</p>

<p>The flesh would like fray out like sea anemones!</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:migvefzybJqEHkJherJB]]</p>

<p>The butter beehoon (thick vermicelli) crab is their signature dish. It doesn't look much but I tell you the soup is.. you gotta try it out for yourself man. Butter and crab goodness!</p>
